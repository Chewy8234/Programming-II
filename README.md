# Programming-II
The purpose of the project is to help the user to get prepare for interviews using a book called Cracking the Coding Interview  6th edition - 189 Programming Questions and Solutions by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell. The user has an opportunity to pick three topics that will help them in either arrays and strings, linked lists, and sorting and searching. The way that this program will work will be after the user picks the topic they want to cover then they have an option to pick whether the use wants a hint, if the user does not want a hint then they will be presented a part of the code that they have to finish.The project is the final project for my Programming II course.
